# Milestone 2 Implementation Notes

## Phase A: 2.5-D Parallax Implementation

### Completed Tasks
- A1 ✓ Depth prop confirmed in types/api.ts (KnowledgeNodeData interface)
- A2 ✓ ReactFlow wrapper with CSS perspective transformation
- A3 ✓ Applied translateZ transformation in KnowledgeNode component
- A4 ✓ Extended useReactFlowViewport hook with zoom-aware scaling 
- A5 ✓ Verified CanvasToolbar with "Preview Depth" toggle (localStorage persistence)

### Technical Details
1. **Perspective & Parallax**
   - Added CSS classes for `.rf-parallax-wrapper` with 800px perspective
   - Toggle between `.rf-parallax-wrapper` and `.preview-depth-off` based on user preference

2. **Zoom-Aware Depth Scaling**
   - Implemented formula: `adjustedZ = baseDepth * baseScale * (1/zoom)`
   - This ensures consistent parallax effect regardless of zoom level
   
3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Used React.memo and minimized re-renders
   - Leveraged ReactFlow's internal store for viewport changes
   - Applied hardware-accelerated CSS transforms with `transform-style: preserve-3d`

### User Experience
The parallax effect creates a subtle depth perception where nodes appear to move at different rates when panning the canvas. Higher depth values (closer to the camera) make nodes appear to move faster relative to lower depth nodes. This enhances spatial understanding of the knowledge graph without being visually overwhelming.

The "Preview Depth" toggle in the toolbar provides users with the ability to enable/disable this effect according to their preference, with the setting persisted across sessions. 

## Phase B: InspectorPanel Split

### Completed Tasks
- B1 ✓ Used existing `useInspectorData` hook in InspectorPanel.tsx
- B2 ✓ Removed direct store access from InspectorPanel.tsx
- B3 ✓ Simplified component styling and markup
- B4 ✓ Verified functionality works as expected

### Technical Details
1. **Component/Hook Separation**
   - InspectorPanel.tsx is now a pure presentation component
   - All data fetching and state management is handled by useInspectorData.ts
   - Inspector state such as selectedNode, selectedEdge, and nodeContextCache is accessed only through the hook

2. **Code Organization**
   - Reduced inline comments and simplified JSX structure
   - Maintained all visual functionality while reducing complexity
   - Removed debug code and console logging

### User Experience
The refactoring maintains the exact same user experience while improving code maintainability. The inspector panel still shows detailed information about selected nodes and edges, allows editing of node labels, and displays additional context for nodes with Knowledge Index IDs.
